There is however much that we do know about Catnip and cats even if we don’t have the ultimate answer of exactly “why?” yet answered.</p><p>##The Science Stuff</p><p>Catnip is scientifically classified as Nepeta cataria and is a perennial herb from the mint family and is in fact also referred to as “Catmint”. It is a plant indigenous to Europe but has been exported and is now found all over including the United States and Canada. There are about 250 species in this plant family which is popular in herb gardens and grows widely as a weed.</p><p>Catnip plants contain volatile oils, acids, sterols and tannins. Cats get high from a chemical in this plant called nepetalactone which binds to receptors inside a cat’s nose, stimulating sensory neurons leading into the brain. Catnip is considered to be non addictive and completely harmless to cats although the reaction can be like one too many martinis. Cats will vary in their response but it can range from wild and crazy to totally oblivious in that classic “who cares” manner that cats do so well.</p><p>##Catnip and Kitty</p><p>Catnip affects approximately half of all cats. What determines whether or not a cat will react to Catnip is a genome that is inherited (or not inherited as the case may be) at birth. Kittens, regardless of whether or not they carry this genome, do not react to Catnip until reaching about 3 or 4 months of age and becoming sexually mature. Older cats are also more likely to have a diminished or non-existing reaction to Catnip, which leads scientists to believe that the Catnip effect is based at least partially on sexuality and that the reaction may be something like an aphrodisiac. Further adding to this belief is the similarity of a sexual pheromone found in the urine of the male cat to nepetalactone (the active product in Catnip).</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://mrtejas99.github.com/>&copy; CatWorld 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
